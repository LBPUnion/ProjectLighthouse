# Project Lighthouse

Project Lighthouse is a clean-room, open-source custom server for LittleBigPlanet. This is a project conducted by
the [LBP Union Ministry of Technology Research and Development team](https://www.lbpunion.com/technology).

For concerns and inquiries about the project, please contact us [here](https://www.lbpunion.com/contact).

For general questions and discussion about Project Lighthouse, please see
the [megathread](https://www.lbpunion.com/forum/union-hall/project-lighthouse-littlebigplanet-private-servers-megathread)
on our forum.

## DISCLAIMER

This is **beta software**, and thus is **not stable nor is it secure**.

While Project Lighthouse is in a mostly working state, **we ask that our software not be used in a production
environment until release**.

This is because we have not entirely nailed security down yet, and **your instance WILL get attacked** as a result. It's
happened before, and it'll happen again.

Simply put, **Project Lighthouse is not ready for the general public yet**.

In addition, we're not responsible if someone hacks your machine and wipes your database, so make frequent backups, and
be sure to report any vulnerabilities. Thank you in advance.

## Building

This will be written when we're out of beta. Consider this your barrier to entry ;).

It is recommended to build with `Release` if you plan to use Lighthouse in a production environment.
